It demonstrates a simple ROP chain which will call the shutdown syscall from within IOS_USB and restart your console. (5.5.1 only.) I'm posting this here in the hope that someone might build on this and get privileged execution on the ARM, perhaps by implementing the IOS_CreateThread exploit that is detailed on the wiki, and then share it publicly.\\n\\nHow this works is described in detail on the wiki but you might like to know that the ROP chain overwrites the return address for the subroutine at 0x1011D968. The return address is at 0x1016AD40. The thread's stack is within the range [0x1015AE50, 0x1016AE50). You might also like to know that MEM1 is mapped R/W on the PPC side at 0xF4000000 and on the ARM side at 0x00000000.\\n\\n  ",

            "details": "OpenSupaplex is an open-source reimplementation of Supaplex by sergiou87. Supaplex is a video game created by Philip Jespersen and Michael Stopp, two Swiss students, and published by Digital Integration in 1991. It is an extended clone of Boulder Dash.\\n\\nSupaplex introduces a number of new elements that were not present in Boulder Dash, including bugs, pieces of base that randomly cause a life-threatening electrostatic discharges, Ports, which limit Murphy's movement to specific directions, and terminals, which set off yellow Utility Disks. Utility Disks are explosive floppy disks and come in three different colors: Orange Disks work like Zonks, but explode when hit or when falling. Yellow Disks do not fall yet may be pushed in any direction, but not pulled (which allows creating Sokoban-like puzzles), and explode when the Terminal is used. Red Disks can be carried and dropped when convenient, exploding seconds after.\\n\\nSupaplex is the first Boulder Dash-like game that is not fully grid-based: while the playing field is an obvious grid, the objects do not 'snap' from one grid position to another, but can be halfway or 'in between' grid positions while moving or falling. This behavior has led to a number of well-known bugs that can be turned to the player's advantage, many of which need to be exploited to complete fan-made levels. For instance, by turning around quickly, the player can cause an enemy or rock to 'bounce' off Murphy.\\n\\nThe game also applies 'gravity' on some levels, which means that Murphy will fall down empty spaces and will be unable to go back up, unless he climbs up by using bases. Gravity is not actually designated - the player can only notice via trial-and-error.\\n\\nControls:\\n- Up/Down/Left/Right: left joystick or directional pad\\n- Removing bases/infotrons next to Murphy: Y button + direction\\n- Detonate red disk: hold Y button\\n- Show/hide bottom game panel: X button\\n- Show number of red disks: A button\\n- Change game speed: L and R buttons\\n- Exit/back: - button\\n- Pause: + button",

This happens because the game still checks the console region in order to decide what folders and files to load. If of a different region, the game will not find the right folders/files and would freeze.\\n\\nHow do I use it?\\n\\nJust run the elf in HBL, choose the region and language you want to enforce and press A. You will be redirected to the Wii U menu. Every game you run will think the console region and language are the ones you selected.\\n\\nTo disable Spiik, just go back to the HBL/HBLC.\\n",

U + NSLU)\\nShow locations as an error when it can't create a folder.\\nAs a workaround, ask user to reinsert their discs. This is due to how Dumpling needs an disc inserting event at the moment.\\n\\n2.1.1\\n\\nFix disc dumping which I broke in the previous release! I've tested it this time however!\\nSeeprom dumping is also fixed, so the online mode dumping should now work correctly!\\nDump size scanning is reworked and is no longer required. It'll show the pros and cons of the scanning the dump size before dumping.\\nDump size scanning is also fixed to scan the correct dumping size, which fixes situations where it incorrectly complains about a lack of space and the overall dumping progress being shown incorrectly.\\nMight be slightly faster for games that have many files.\\n\\n2.1.0\\n\\nIntegrated Dumpling's own CFW! You no longer need to have started Mocha or Haxchi before running Dumpling!\\nAdded otp.bin and seeprom.bin dumping! No longer requires nand dumper to dump additional files for online play!\\nFixed disc dumping not working for Haxchi users!\\nDisc dumping is made more stable and faster!\\nCan insert and unplug USB sticks while Dumpling is running.

Breath of the Wild updates for example should no longer take an actual eternity!\\nFaster meta parsing resulting in very fast booting times. I bet you won't even see the credits!\\nA new GUI which is much simpler!\\nJust overall more coherency in terms of dumping games.\\nMany QoL improvements!\\nUses a fully new toolchain called WUT, which should improve the code quality since it allows us to use new features. Only really noticeable in the binary size, which is much smaller.\\nMuch improved code structure that was designed from the ground up. Good for future updates to be build upon!\\n\\n1.1.2\\n\\nDiscs with a system update no longer freeze on fetching metadata\\nCharacters such as colons and periods have been removed when dumping to avoid errors\\n\\n1.1.1\\nSupport for dumping only specific parts of a title\\ne.g. only dump the save instead of everything\\nHaxchi support has been added\\nSupport for extra controllers has been added\\nGeneral menu and UI improvements\\nAccount data will now dump to dumpling/account_data instead of dumpling/online_files.\\nThanks to @GaryOderNichts for implementing Haxchi and controller support\\n\\n1.0.1\\n\\nThis release adds the option to dump specific games, rather than just dumping all of them.\\nWhen you dump a game, it'll grab the game, update, DLC and save file for the game if they exist.

It gives you the same ability as a custom firmware with signature patches except it does not require a custom fw.img on your SD card or anything else. This makes it perfectly shareable in contrary to a full fw.img.\\n\\nWhat you can do if you use it is install custom channels like the HBL channel and launch those channels that would normally fail because of some signature checks. Additional to that this does not require to make a full OS relaunch with a fw.img and therefore it loads much faster then the full custom fw.img. The version that just goes back to HBL is actually very fast.\\n\\nWhat you don't get with this compared to a full custom fw.img is a wupserver or libiosuhax /dev node. You can't use wupclient or ftpiiu everywhere with this. It could probably be extended in the future, especially the /dev node part is quite easy to add/modify, but for now it is a simple signature check patcher.\\n\\nThe following signature checks are all patched out by this (which is equivalent to a custom fw.img):\\ncert verification\\ncached cert check\\nMCP authentication check\\npublic key verification check\\nbootLogoTex and bootMovie.h264 check\\nregion title launch check\\n  ",

I'm looking into making this faster, but it's not too bad for most levels.\\n---- * Note: There is a known bug involving the Freedoom WADs (and probably others) - details below\\n* Controller rebinding\\n---- * Currently this can only be achieved by editing crispy-doom.cfg. In the future this will be made easier by doing it through the launcher.\\n* Optional toggle to fix the blockmap bug (on page 4 of the Crispy menu)\\n\\n=== What's not perfect (yet) ===\\n\\nAs this is a pre-release, not everything is perfect yet. Here are a list of some things to be aware of.\\n\\n* High resolution rendering is laggy\\n---- * When high resolution rendering is enabled (especially when combined with widescreen), the game becomes notably laggy. This is a bit of a surprise to me since I figured the Wii U would be totally capable of running this game at higher resolutions right out of the box. More optimizations are needed, I hope that I will be able to get this to work at full speed without major changes to the renderer. I also might just be doing something very wrong/inefficient so we'll see :)\\n* No networking support\\n---- * SDL2_net is not supported on the Wii U, so for now, this is single player only.\\n* Launcher is lacking features\\n---- * I plan on improving the launcher in the future to let you add additional parameters if you'd like (such as -fast, -nomonsters, -warp xy etc), record/play back demos, and rebind controls.\\n* No controllers other than the Wii U Gamepad\\n---- * Currently, I have hard coded it to only use the Wii U Gamepad. I will expand it with support for other controllers in the future, it doesn't seem to be too hard.\\n* No cheats\\n---- * Since there is no keyboard, you cannot enter any cheat codes. I plan to rectify this by adding a menu to control the cheats from there.\\n\\n=== Known Bugs ===\\n\\n* If the Wii U Gamepad disconnects, reconnecting it will NOT regain control of the game. Quitting with the Home button still works though.\\n* When playing with a Freedoom WAD (and probably others), the music will sometimes not work. You might need to switch to a different stage then switch back to kick-start music into working.\\n---- * I have a feeling this is because Freedoom uses midi files rather than mus files that that doesn't play perfectly with my music speedup hack. Looking into it.\\n\\n=== Default Controls ===\\n\\nMove | Left stick\\nAim | Right stick\\nUse | A\\nFire | ZR\\nJump (if enabled) | B\\nToggle automap | Minus\\nToggle automap overlay mode | Y\\nToggle automap rotation mode | X\\nPrevious weapon | L\\nNext weapon | R\\nSelect shotgun | D-pad up\\nSelect chaingun | D-pad right\\nSelect rocket launcher | D-pad down\\nSelect plasma rifle | D-pad left",
