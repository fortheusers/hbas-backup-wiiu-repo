  "changelog": "2.1.4\\n\\nAllow discs to be detected even if you insert them before Dumpling has started.\\n\\n2.1.3\\n\\nAdd eShop key file to the Online Cemu Files dumping option\\n\\n2.1.2\\n\\nFixes ability to dump some games with weird names (like NSMBU. U + NSLU)\\nShow locations as an error when it can't create a folder.\\nAs a workaround, ask user to reinsert their discs. This is due to how Dumpling needs an disc inserting event at the moment.\\n\\n2.1.1\\n\\nFix disc dumping which I broke in the previous release! I've tested it this time however!\\nSeeprom dumping is also fixed, so the online mode dumping should now work correctly!\\nDump size scanning is reworked and is no longer required. It'll show the pros and cons of the scanning the dump size before dumping.\\nDump size scanning is also fixed to scan the correct dumping size, which fixes situations where it incorrectly complains about a lack of space and the overall dumping progress being shown incorrectly.\\nMight be slightly faster for games that have many files.\\n\\n2.1.0\\n\\nIntegrated Dumpling's own CFW! You no longer need to have started Mocha or Haxchi before running Dumpling!\\nAdded otp.bin and seeprom.bin dumping! No longer requires nand dumper to dump additional files for online play!\\nFixed disc dumping not working for Haxchi users!\\nDisc dumping is made more stable and faster!\\nCan insert and unplug USB sticks while Dumpling is running. Would require restarting Dumpling previously.\\nAdded warning that USB stick must use single partition since USB sticks might not be detected otherwise.\\nRemoved compatibility files option since Online Dumping option already covers those files.\\n\\n2.0.4\\n\\nFix option menu not showing up in the disc copy menu, so now you can dump your discs to the USB stick.\\nDump mii files when dumping online files, so now they'll show up properly in online games.\\nRemove some requirements for a complete copy, so Japanese games should dump properly now.\\nShow some extra information when it fails to write to the SD card or USB stick.\\nShow version number in Dumpling itself.\\n\\n2.0.3\\n\\nFix .rpx files from discs not being dumped correctly, causing them to be corrupted.\\n\\n2.0.2\\nFix that the game dumps weren't put into a subdirectory for each game - whoops!\\nMake the start of the dumping process faster.\\n\\n2.0\\nFully reworked from dumpling-classic, there's too many changes to list.\\nTo just list the most important ones:\\n\\nFixed the super slow transfers, it's now much faster overall. Breath of the Wild updates for example should no longer take an actual eternity!\\nFaster meta parsing resulting in very fast booting times. I bet you won't even see the credits!\\nA new GUI which is much simpler!\\nJust overall more coherency in terms of dumping games.\\nMany QoL improvements!\\nUses a fully new toolchain called WUT, which should improve the code quality since it allows us to use new features. Only really noticeable in the binary size, which is much smaller.\\nMuch improved code structure that was designed from the ground up. Good for future updates to be build upon!\\n\\n1.1.2\\n\\nDiscs with a system update no longer freeze on fetching metadata\\nCharacters such as colons and periods have been removed when dumping to avoid errors\\n\\n1.1.1\\nSupport for dumping only specific parts of a title\\ne.g. only dump the save instead of everything\\nHaxchi support has been added\\nSupport for extra controllers has been added\\nGeneral menu and UI improvements\\nAccount data will now dump to dumpling/account_data instead of dumpling/online_files.\\nThanks to @GaryOderNichts for implementing Haxchi and controller support\\n\\n1.0.1\\n\\nThis release adds the option to dump specific games, rather than just dumping all of them.\\nWhen you dump a game, it'll grab the game, update, DLC and save file for the game if they exist. When you initially load the menu, it'll take a while to fetch the metadata for each game but afterwards it won't need to do that again until you reload the app.\\n\\nThis version also includes a lot of minor fixes and improvements, specifically to how the app handles dumping from USB storage.\\n\\nv1.0.1 fixes a typo in v1.0.\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n- You can now dump physical game discs to USB/SD\\n- The dumps will be created at /dumpling/disc on your storage device\\n- MLC tab has been renamed to System\\n\\n0.3\\n\\nYou can now dump to a FAT32 USB drive from dumpling.\\n1. Plug your drive into your Wii U\\n2. Launch dumpling\\n3. Use ZL/ZR to toggle dump target\\n4. Dump!\\n\\n0.2.2\\n\\nYou can now cancel halfway through a dump by holding down B.\\n\\n0.2\\n\\nThis release now lets you dump titles from a USB storage device instead of NAND."
