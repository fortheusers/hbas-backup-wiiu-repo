	<short_description>WIP VNC client for Wii U</short_description>
<long_description>A VNC client for remotely viewing a computer that's running a VNC server. Currently does not have support for controlling the remote computer, and the target IP must be set up on the SD card by editing the file at sd:/vnc.txt.

The file should be a text file on the SD card at sd:/vnc.txt with the following format, separated by newlines:
[IP address]
[password]
