  "description": "Play Doom on the Wii U",
  "details": "This is a Wii U port of Crispy Doom. It is possible thanks to the amazing efforts of the Crispy/Chocolate Doom authors, devkitPro, and the team that ported SDL2 to the Wii U. Without these people, this port would be a lot harder to make :)\\n\\n*NOTE*: This download includes the WAD files Freedoom: Phase 1&2. If you would like to play your own WADs (such as the original DOOM.WAD or DOOM2.WAD), put them in: \"sd:/wiiu/apps/crispy-doom-u/wads\".\\n\\n=== Features ===\\n\\n* Up to date with Crispy Doom 5.10.3 (up to commit 3cde09b)\\n* Very high feature parity with the PC version, full Crispy menu intact (other than things not relevant to a Wii U release)\\n* Smooth analog control support - both moving and turning make use of the analog values of the analog sticks\\n* Simple launcher that lets you pick an IWAD and optionally PWADs\\n* Music support using OPL3\\n---- * Causes a bit of a stutter when loading a new music track. I'm looking into making this faster, but it's not too bad for most levels.\\n---- * Note: There is a known bug involving the Freedoom WADs (and probably others) - details below\\n* Controller rebinding\\n---- * Currently this can only be achieved by editing crispy-doom.cfg. In the future this will be made easier by doing it through the launcher.\\n* Optional toggle to fix the blockmap bug (on page 4 of the Crispy menu)\\n\\n=== What's not perfect (yet) ===\\n\\nAs this is a pre-release, not everything is perfect yet. Here are a list of some things to be aware of.\\n\\n* High resolution rendering is laggy\\n---- * When high resolution rendering is enabled (especially when combined with widescreen), the game becomes notably laggy. This is a bit of a surprise to me since I figured the Wii U would be totally capable of running this game at higher resolutions right out of the box. More optimizations are needed, I hope that I will be able to get this to work at full speed without major changes to the renderer. I also might just be doing something very wrong/inefficient so we'll see :)\\n* No networking support\\n---- * SDL2_net is not supported on the Wii U, so for now, this is single player only.\\n* Launcher is lacking features\\n---- * I plan on improving the launcher in the future to let you add additional parameters if you'd like (such as -fast, -nomonsters, -warp xy etc), record/play back demos, and rebind controls.\\n* No controllers other than the Wii U Gamepad\\n---- * Currently, I have hard coded it to only use the Wii U Gamepad. I will expand it with support for other controllers in the future, it doesn't seem to be too hard.\\n* No cheats\\n---- * Since there is no keyboard, you cannot enter any cheat codes. I plan to rectify this by adding a menu to control the cheats from there.\\n\\n=== Known Bugs ===\\n\\n* If the Wii U Gamepad disconnects, reconnecting it will NOT regain control of the game. Quitting with the Home button still works though.\\n* When playing with a Freedoom WAD (and probably others), the music will sometimes not work. You might need to switch to a different stage then switch back to kick-start music into working.\\n---- * I have a feeling this is because Freedoom uses midi files rather than mus files that that doesn't play perfectly with my music speedup hack. Looking into it.\\n\\n=== Default Controls ===\\n\\nMove | Left stick\\nAim | Right stick\\nUse | A\\nFire | ZR\\nJump (if enabled) | B\\nToggle automap | Minus\\nToggle automap overlay mode | Y\\nToggle automap rotation mode | X\\nPrevious weapon | L\\nNext weapon | R\\nSelect shotgun | D-pad up\\nSelect chaingun | D-pad right\\nSelect rocket launcher | D-pad down\\nSelect plasma rifle | D-pad left",
