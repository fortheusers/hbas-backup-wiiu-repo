Everything will land in a folder called tik2sd on your sd card root, console tickets will be in numbered subfolders, keys will be listed in keys.txt. The ticket of the currently inserted disc will land in a odd folder with its title id as its name. The whole process only takes a few seconds.\\n  ",
