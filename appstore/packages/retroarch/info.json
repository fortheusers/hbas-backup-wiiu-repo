  "details": "Notice: This is a fairly large package, so it may take some time to download! Therefore, in order to keep file sizes down, this package contains only four cores: mgba, gambatte, nestopia, snes9x. For other cores, see the 'More RA Cores' and 'Arcade Cores' packages. For more themes, use the built-in Online Updater.\\n\\nOpen-source and free cross-platform front-end of the libretro API for videogame emulators, game engines, media players and other applications, handled as cores by the Front-end.",
