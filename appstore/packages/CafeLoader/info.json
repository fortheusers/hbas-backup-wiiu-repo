(Without -. All letters must be uppercase)\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nsd:/cafeloader/0005000010101D00\\nClient\\nCafeLoader provides a client which can be used to replace game files (Just like Cafiine).\\n\\nIn order for the Wii U to know which PC on the network it's looking to connect to, you have to type in your PC's IP in a file named ip.bin and place it in:\\n\\nsd:/cafeloader\\nclient.py is able to generate an ip.bin for you if you run it with --bin as an argument, like this:\\n\\npy -3 client.py --bin\\nYour game's content folder would placed in the following directory (relative to client.py):\\n\\nvol/TITLE_ID/content\\nAgain, where TITLE_ID is the title ID of the game you want to patch. (Without -. All letters must be uppercase)\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nvol/0005000010101D00/content",
